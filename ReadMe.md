# Computer Vision Challenge
This is the final project  of Team 30, consisting of R.Jacumet,
M.Schneider, O.Inak and A.Misik. The goal of the Computer Vision
Challenge is to develop an application capable of visualizing the visible
changes between two or more satellite images of the same point on the Earth.

## Requirements 
The application must be able to handle images that meet the following requirements:â€‚
 
*For a single location*

-Different views
 
-Rotated views

-Translated views

-Different brightness/illumination situations.

*For multiple locations*

-Different points in the world

-Different recording heights

-Different brightness/illumination situations.

Furthermore, an GUI shall be developed that gives the user the opportunity
to:

-Select images

-Define the type of visualization (e.g. time lapse)

-Define the type of change between the frames (e.g. big/small changes)
